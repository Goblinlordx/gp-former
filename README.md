# GP Former <sup><sub>[üåê][4]</sub></sup> ![Node.js CI](https://github.com/Goblinlordx/gp-former/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)
This project is a web application for creating randomized setups for the board game [Gaia Project][1].  The intent is to provide fast and free scenario generation not just online but offline as well (offline currently work in progress).

## Getting Started

#### Dependencies

-   [Node.js v13+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn lint`

Lints code based on [prettier][3].  You can run `yarn lint:fix` to fix most lint errors.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
